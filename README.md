# Competition Hub

A modern web platform for discovering and registering for competitions across various categories.

## Overview

Competition Hub provides a centralized location where users can browse available competitions, view details, and register through a streamlined process. Built with React and React Router DOM, the application offers a smooth, single-page experience with intuitive navigation.

## Features

- **Competition Directory**: Browse through a comprehensive list of available competitions
- **Detail Views**: Access in-depth information about each competition
- **Registration System**: Register for competitions through an integrated form
- **Responsive Design**: Enjoy a seamless experience across desktop and mobile devices

## Technical Implementation

### React Router Integration

The application uses React Router DOM to handle navigation between different views without page refreshes:

- `/` - Complete listing of all competitions
- `/register/:id` - Registration form for the selected competition

### User Flow

1. Users browse the competition listings on the main page
3. The "Register" button redirects to a dedicated registration form
4. Form submissions are validated before processing
